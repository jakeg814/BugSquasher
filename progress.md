<ul>
<li>5/23/22: Mainly a research day. Spent most of the time setting up a basic frontend rough draft, and trying to figure out what needs to be implemented into this application. I probably should have done just a bit more research too, but I'm really happy with the progress so far. A lot of good progress in just the first day.</li>
